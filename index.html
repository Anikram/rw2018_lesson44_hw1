        <h2 class="subtitle">Imagine what you could build if you learned Ruby on Rails…</h2>
        <p>Ruby on Rails makes it much easier and more fun. It includes everything you
          need to build fantastic applications, and you can learn it with the support of
          our large, friendly community.</p>

        built with Ruby on Rails: Basecamp, GitHub, Shopify, Airbnb, Twitch, SoundCloud,
        Hulu, Zendesk, Square, Highrise. Those are just some of the big names, but there
        are literally hundreds of thousands of applications built with the framework since
        its release in 2004.

      <div class="text-block">
        <h2 class="subtitle">Ruby on Rails is open source software,</h2>
        <p>so not only is it free to use, you can also help make it better. More than 4,500
          people already have contributed code to Rails. It’s easier than you think to become
          one of them.</p>

        Configuration is how we roll. Ruby on Rails has been popularizing both concepts
        along with a variety of other controversial points since the beginning. To learn more
        about why Rails is so different from many other web-application frameworks and paradigms,
